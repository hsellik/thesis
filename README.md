# Learning Off-By-One Mistakes: An Empirical Study
This repository contains the data and code to replicate MSR 2021 paper `Learning Off-By-One Mistakes: An Empirical Study`.
It contains the models' source code that find off-by-one erros in Java source code.

## Quick Start
There are 3 different models:  
* [Code2Seq](code2seq)  
* [Code2Vec](code2vec)  
* [Baseline](baseline)  

You can find documentation on using them in their respective folders.

### Source Code for Demo Webpage
[Offside webpage](offside-webpage) contains files for a demo web-page to illustrate the working of the Code2Seq based 
model. See the folder for additional information.
